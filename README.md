# Network-Programming
Set of interesting Network Programming problems.

These are the problems which I have completed as a part of course on Netwrok Programming.
It consists of various client-server TCP and UDP applications. 
Some of the interesting problems are development of a community server and a DNS query tool.
The actual problem statements are present as PDFs inside the respective folders.
